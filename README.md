# 🌾 FarmVerse: Rebirth in a Living Economy
*You open your eyes. Warm sunlight filters through the leaves, dry wheat rustles beneath your feet.
The world is empty, but the land is alive. And it waits for you.*
# ❓ What is this?
FarmVerse is not just a game.
It is a new life in a world where every plot of land, every seed, and every trade carries real meaning.
It is a farming simulator built on Xsolla ZK — an Ethereum Layer 2 solution for gaming, where the economy lives by blockchain rules, not developer whim.

You are not a player.
You are a reborn farmer in a new world, discovering the wonders of decentralized agriculture.
Everything you grow, own, and trade truly belongs to you.
Every action leaves a mark on the blockchain — and in the story of FarmVerse.
# 🔮 World History
Once, this was an ordinary world of farmers.
But the economy rotted under centralization — seeds were all priced the same, crops had no value, and labor went unrewarded.

Then FarmVerse was born,
a world where each farmer owns their fate,
where prices emerge from players’ actions,
and where random events turn the economy into a living, breathing organism.

You are part of this story.
Every contract, every trade, every farm is a pixel on the vast canvas written in code and soil.
# 💡 Why It Matters
## 🔓 **You Are the Owner, Not a Tenant**

Every item, plot, and tool is an NFT belonging to you.
This is not just an “in-game item.”
It is an asset you can hold, sell, or trade.

## ⚖️ **A Breathing Economy**

Prices form based on the market and events.
Mills, crops, and players affect each other.
The world reacts to you — not the other way around.

## 💬 **Community, Not a Solo Game**

Players can form cooperatives, trade goods, and collectively manage the world’s economy.

# 🌱 MVP: A Farm That Lives by Its Own Rules

In the minimal prototype, we implement core mechanics to showcase the full potential of the concept:

🧩 Land — each plot is unique, managed by the player, and can be used for different crops.

🌾 Seeds — purchased in the shop, grow in your fields, and can be sold for profit.

🏭 Mill (first factory) — consumes grain, creating demand and affecting market prices.

💰 In-game tokens — the foundation of the economy. Players trade, speculate, and manage resources.

🎲 Random events(for example):

🌪 Locust swarms — destroy part of your crops

🌧 Rain — increases harvest yields

☀️ No events — market stability

# 🧠 Artificial Intelligence

Events are not truly random — in the future, they will be AI-generated, reflecting collective actions of farmers.

# 🧩 Technical Foundation

FarmVerse is built on Solidity smart contracts and deployed on the Xsolla ZK Sepolia Testnet:

ERC20 (FRM) — in-game currency

ERC721 (NFT) — land, seeds, factories

Frontend — React + zkSync SDK + ethers.js

Monorepo structure:

├─ contracts

├─ frontend

├─ scripts

└─ docs

Deployment — Hardhat

Ecosystem — fully EVM-compatible

# 🧠 Problems FarmVerse Solves
| 💥 Problem in Web2 Games | 🌾 FarmVerse Solution |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| In-game items don’t belong to players | All assets are NFTs on the blockchain |
| Economy is static and centralized | Market formed by player actions |
| Game currency has no real value | FRM — a real ERC20 token |
| World does not react to players | AI events and market react to all actions |
| Games are isolated from each other | Open API and GameFi-standard interfaces |


# 🧠 MVP Philosophy
_"Small is a mirror of big."_`

Our MVP is minimalistic, yet it reveals the full idea of FarmVerse:

dynamic economy

living market

NFT ownership

decentralization

impact of random events

This is not just a demo — it is proof that Web3 can create a living, self-regulating world.

# 🌍 Path Forward
🌾 New factories: bakeries, oil mills, dairies

🤝 Players form communities

🧠 AI governs weather, yields, and disasters

🗺 Open world with trading towns and shared markets

🪙 Integration with other dApps via standard interfaces

✨ Manifest of the New World Farmers

We believe that labor should be rewarded,
that ownership is freedom,
and that economy is life.
FarmVerse is not just a game.
It is a place where you are reborn,
to explore the wonders of the farming world
and build an economy where everything is fair and meaningful.
